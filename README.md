# MyraTexturePacker
MyraTexturePacker is a console utility for making a texture atlas.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet tool install --global myratexpack
```

## Update

```bash
dotnet tool update --global myratexpack
```

# Usage
`myratexpack <input_folder> <output_file> [width] [height]`

E.g.
`myratexpack "C:\Temp" "C:\Temp\my_atlas.png"`

That command will process all images in the folder "C:\Temp" and create a texture atlas from them.

`width` and `height` are optional parameters. If they aren't provided, then default values 256x256 are used.
If the images don't fit on the atlas, then its size is doubled until the images fit.

The texture atlas will consist of two files: my_atlas.png (atlas image) and my_atlas.xmat (atlas definition in XML format).

MyraTexturePacker supports nine patch images. In order to use that feature, the input image name must have ".9" before the extension (e.g. `image.9.png`). Also, such an image must have a 1px border with black lines marking stretchable areas.
